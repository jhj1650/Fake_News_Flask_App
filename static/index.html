              Replace all labels and inputs with the relevant features for your
              model
              Attributes to note:
              id: this is used on the front end to link the label to the input
              name: this is used on the back end when you submit the form; it
                becomes the key in the params dictionary
              value: this is the default value of the input. not necessary but
                helpful for speeding up demos

              The <br>s between each label/input combo are a quick and easy way
              to put each one on its own line. They aren't necessary for the
              form to function but they help the flow without needing a lot of
              nested <div>s to achieve the desired layout
